# Sleep-Disorder-and-Lifestyle-Analysis

Sleep disorders are common and can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. Developing a model to accurately predict sleep disorders can help identify at-risk individuals and provide targeted interventions. By analyzing a dataset that includes data on sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity levels, stress levels, BMI categories, and the presence of sleep disorders, we aim to gain insights into how these lifestyle factors may influence sleep quality and the prevalence of sleep disorders.  

The project involves obtaining and preprocessing data, training models, evaluating performance, analyzing influential features, and providing actionable recommendations. The goal is to develop an accurate and interpretable model that can help identify and manage sleep disorders.
